            <h1>ðŸ¤£ Rolling on the Floor Laughing </h1>
            <p> A yellow face with a big grin and scrunched, X-shaped eyes, tilted on its side as if rolling on the floor laughing (the internet acronym ROFL). Sheds two tears and tilts right on most platforms. Often conveys hysterical laughter more intense than ðŸ˜‚ Face With Tears of Joy.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h1>ðŸ¤© Star-Struck</h1>
            <p>  A yellow face with a broad, open smile, showing upper teeth on most platforms, with stars for eyes, as if seeing a beloved celebrity. Color of stars widely varies by platform, though commonly gold or red. May express that someone or something is amazing, fascinating, impressive, or exciting.
            </p>

            <p>  A yellow face with raised eyebrows, dollar signs for eyes, and an open smile sticking out a tongue styled after a green, dollar banknote. Some platforms depict the dollar-sign eyes in green circles.

            <h1>ðŸ¤ª Zany Face</h1>
            <p>  A smiley making a silly face. A yellow face with a big grin and wide, white eyes, one larger than the other and in a wild, cockeyed expression. Many platforms, including Apple, depict its tongue stuck out and head tilted; others feature a full-toothed grin, giving it a more unhinged appearance.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>ðŸ˜Ž Smiling Face with Sunglasses</h1>
            <p>   A yellow face with a broad, closed smile wearing black sunglasses, as if a pair of classic Wayfarers. Often used to convey the slang sense of cool. May also express a confident, carefree attitude or that something is excellent.</p>
